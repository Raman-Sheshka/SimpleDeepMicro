# DeepMicro project

DeepMicro is a deep representation learning framework for disease prediction based on microbiome data. It is implemented in Python and built on top of Keras and scikit-learn. It is easy to use and can be run on CPU or GPU.

- [] OOP project structure
    - [] define model class
    - [] use sklearn only for CPU classification
    - [] use keras for GPU classification
    - [] use optuna for hyperparameter optimization on GPU
    - [] use pydantic for data validation and settings
    - [] use yml for configuration by user
- [] define test from nature publication
- [] define Makefile for easy installation, testing, and easy standard runnung
